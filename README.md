# Redata
Monitoring system for data teams.
Computing health checks on data (via Airflow jobs), visualizing them over time, and alerting on them in Grafana.


# Key features

## Metrics layer

Redata computes health metrics for your data, containing information like this:

* time since last record was added
* number of records added in last (hour/day/week/month)
* schema changes that recently happened
* number of nulls in columns over time
* other checks specific to columns in data and their types

*If you have DevOps experience, you can think of it as: prometheus, telegraf for data teams*

## Automatic dashboards

Having metrics in one common format, makes it possible to create dashboards automatically, for all (or chosen) tables
in your data. Currently there are 2 types of dashboard redata creates:
* home dashboard, containing most important information about all tables
* table dashboard, containing information specific to given table and columns in it

Here are some examples of how generated Grafana dashboards look like:

<br>
*Get a glimpse of what's happening in all your tables on one screen. If you see, any suspicious numbers click on the tile for more details on this specific table.*

<br>
*Get an in-depth view of your table, learn about any schema changes, volume fluctuations, nulls in columns, and other useful metrics.*

## Batteries included

No need to setup Airflow, Grafana or DB for storing metrics. Redata will setup all of those via Docker images, you need to deploy only one thing.

*Easy production deployment on AWS, GCP is something we will be working on, currentlly you would need to figure it out yourself, what we have is docker-compose for setting up pieces to make it work*

# Benefits over doing monitoring yourself
Grafana supports PostgreSQL and lot of others DBs, so what are benefits of using redata over setting monitoring yourself with couple of SQL queries?
Here is a our list :)

 * **Visualizing all tables together in one dashbard** - Computing metrics layer make it really easy to do visulizations for many/all tables at once and showing them under one dashboard.
 
 * **Visualizing new, previously impossible things** - Things like schema changes, cannot be queried from DB, but computing metrics over time makes showing those possible.
 
 * **Visualizing how things change over time** - If you are doing any updates to DB, like updating row status etc. it's impossible to visualize how things looked liked in the past and compare it to now (for alerting purposes etc.), adding metrics layer makes it easy.
 
 * **Automatic and up to date dashboards** - It's normally quite cumbersome to setup proper monitoring for all tables and keeping it up to date is hard - redata can do that for you, detecting new tables and columns and automatically creating dashboards/panels for them.

# Getting started (local machine setup)

```
git clone https://github.com/redata-team/redata.git

cp env_template .env
# create REDATA_SOURCE_DB_URL_YOUR_DB_NAME variables (at the end of .env file)
# you can add multiple variables for many DBs you want to observe here

docker-compose up
```

## Grafana
Add this point Grafana should be running on http://localhost:3000 (or you docker IP in case of running docker via virtualbox)

First screen you will see there, is login screen. Default password is admin/admin, but if you want can you can change that in .env file (need to be done when staring docker)

To go see dashboards in Grafana goto `Dashboards > Manage`. (Home is by default now showing all dahsboards)

From the main dashboard named: `Home (generated)` you can go to any table specific dashboard, just by clicking tile that shows stats for given table

## Airflow
Airflow should be running and available under: http://localhost:8080/ (or you docker IP)

You should see `validation dag` there, turn in on and it will start running (every 10 minutes or other frequency if specified in `settings.py` file)

You can also manually trigger running dag (by clicking first icon on Link tab)
