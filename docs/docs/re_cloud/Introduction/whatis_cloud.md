# What is re_cloud?

re_data cloud enables you to store & share data reports from different open-source tools including of course **re_data**.

At lof of tools produce reports in the form of static html applications which are very usefull, but we believe they could be much more usefull if they were easy deployable, sharable to others in the organization without a hassle of setting up:
 - S3/GCS storage & hosting
 - VPN for business users
 - custom slack notifications
 - and the list goes on and on
