## uploading to re_cloud

to send re_data to re_cloud, first generate re_data overview and then upload it to re_cloud with a single command.


```
re_data overview generate
re_cloud upload re-data
```

Below we show all the currently supported options on how you can upload re-data to `re_cloud`

```
re_cloud upload re-data --name TEXT --project-dir TEXT --re-data-target-dir TEXT

Options:
  --project-dir TEXT         Which directory to look in for the
                             dbt_project.yml file. Default is the current
                             working directory and its parents

  --re-data-target-dir TEXT  Which directory to store artefacts generated by
                             re_data Defaults to the 'target-path' used in
                             dbt_project.yml

  --name TEXT                Name of the upload used for identification

If you are inside dbt project dir and didn't changed default `target` directory for docs and re_data both `project-dir` and `re-data-target-dir` are optional.
