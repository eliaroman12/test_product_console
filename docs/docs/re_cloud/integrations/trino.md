# Trino

## Overview

re_cloud can you you track anomalies, schema changes and failed data tests in your bigquery tables.
All of this can be done through re_data library. Trino support is currently done by community and not all re_data versions may support Tirno.

## Next steps

Best way to start using re_data is to check out our quicksart tutorials. Either for users using dbt or the ones who are just using data warehouse:

- **[Quickstart - dbt users](/docs/re_data/getting_started/installation/for_dbt_users)**
- **[Quickstart - new to dbt](/docs/re_data/getting_started/installation/new_to_dbt)**


## Trino specific support
