# BigQuery

## Overview

re_cloud can help you track anomalies, schema changes and failed data tests in your BigQuery tables.
All of this can be done through re_data's library which supports BigQuery.


You can check out how monitoring re_data information looks on BigQuery **[here](https://docs.getre.io/ui-latest-bigquery/#/alerts)**

## Next steps

Best way to start using re_data is to check out our quicksart tutorials. Either for users using dbt or the ones who are just using a data warehouse:

- **[Quickstart - dbt users](/docs/re_data/getting_started/installation/for_dbt_users)**
- **[Quickstart - new to dbt](/docs/re_data/getting_started/installation/new_to_dbt)**


## BigQuery specific support

If you have things you would like to monitor specifically for BigQuery let us know on **[Slack! ðŸ˜Š](https://www.getre.io/slack)**. We are looking into adding more feaures for BigQuery in the future.
