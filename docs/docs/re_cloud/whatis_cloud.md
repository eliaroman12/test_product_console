# What is re_cloud?

re_cloud enables you to store outputs and reports from many data open-source tools and share them with team & business users super easily.

On top of that is adds ability to view:
 - view reports history
 - get notifications when reports are updated


# Why do I need it?

We talked with more than a 100 companies on how they are storing output from tools like dbt-docs, great-expectations, our open-source library and others. Answer is almost always the same - S3, GCS, github pages or used to do that.

With re_data with single line of code like:
```
re_cloud upload dbt-docs
```

You can make your outputs available to your team and business users in a few seconds without learning
details on S3 permissions, GCS buckets, github pages or any other tool.

And on top of that you can get slack notifications when reports are updated and view reports history features which are not available in home made solutions.

And we will be bringing more features in the no distant future.
