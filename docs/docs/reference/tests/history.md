# Tests history

re_data adds dbt macros which make it possible to save test history to your data warehouse & later on investigate them with our reliability UI.

## on-run-end
To start saving tests you just need to call re_data `save_test_history` macro in `on-run-end` hook. You can do it by adding the code below into your `dbt_prroject.yml`. In case of having some other hooks existing already you just need to add this as an item into the list.

```yml dbt_project.yml

on-run-end:
  - "{{ re_data.save_test_history(results) }}"

```

:::caution
on-run-end hooks are called for dbt tests since dbt 1.0.0, so this re_data feature is only available with the new dbt version.
