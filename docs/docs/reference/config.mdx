# Configuration ⚙️

To run re_data you would need to configure what tables should be monitored and set up some properties of this monitoring. Currently re_data supports dbt native configuration (by leveraging dbt models & sources configs)as well as configuration by `re_data:monitored` var.

If you are not familiar with dbt models & sources configuration we encourage to check the dbt: [model-configs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/model-configs) and [source-configs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/source-configs) documentation.

re_data dbt native cofiguration follows the same rules as dbt configuration, config block inside model will have the most priority and configuration in `dbt_project.yml` will have the least priority.
Additionaly `re_data` gives the least prority to vars configuration in `re_data:monitored` variable.

:::info
Notice that only `Config block` and `Property file` configuration can only be applied to models, sources 
needs to be configured in `dbt_project.yml` file (as currently, dbt doesn't accept config for them)
:::

:::caution
`re_data:monitored` vars configuration was the first method introduced, but we are currently considering removing this way of configuring monitoring. If you are already using this configuration method, loving it and don't want to migrate, let us know on [Slack](https://www.getre.io/slack)!
:::

You can define configuration on many levels; it's common to enable re_data for a group of tables (for example, all sources). It's also common to override some of the properties for specific groups.

Now let's go over the configuration you can set on models

## Monitoring properties

### re_data_monitored

Set to `true` to enable monitoring for a given table or set of tables.

### re_data_time_filter

SQL expression (for example, column name) to filter records of the table to a specific time range. It can be set to `null` if you wish to compute metrics on the whole table.

### re_data_columns (optional)

Set of columns for which re_data should compute metrics. If not specified, re_data will compute stats for all columns with either numeric or text types.



### re_data_metrics (optional)

Additional metrics to be computed for a given table (set of tables). Those can be either whole `table` level or `column` level. (Check out **[metrics](/docs/reference/metrics/overview_metric)** section to learn distinction between the two)

You can be pass any number of already defined or your custom metrics to be computed. Check out **[extra metrics](/docs/reference/metrics/extra_metrics)** section for available metrics and **[custom metrics](/docs/reference/metrics/your_own_metric)** for ways to define your own metrics.


## Other re_data config vars (optional)

Sample configuration for other parameters can look like that:

```yaml title="Parameters of re_data configuration"
vars:
  # (optional) if not passed, stats for last day will be computed
  re_data:time_window_start: '{{ (run_started_at - modules.datetime.timedelta(1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d 00:00:00") }}'
  re_data:time_window_end: '{{ run_started_at.strftime("%Y-%m-%d 00:00:00") }}'

  # (optional) override standard metrics computed for all your tables
  re_data:metrics_base:
    table:
      - row_count
      - freshness
      - buy_count # my own custom metric
      
    column:
      numeric:
        - min
        - max
        - avg
        - stddev
        - variance
        - nulls_count
        - diff # my own custom metric
        
      text:
        - min_length
        - max_length
        - avg_length
        - nulls_count
        - missing_count

  # (optional) global z_score threshold to used when triggering alerts
  re_data:alerting_z_score: 3

  # (optional) tells how much hisory you want to consider when looking for anomalies
  re_data:anomaly_detection_look_back_days: 30
```

### re_data:time_window_start, re_data:time_window_end

re_data metrics are time-based. (re_data filters all your table data to a specific time window.)
In general, we advise setting up a time window this way that all new data is monitored.
It's also possible to compute metrics from overlapping data for example last 7 days.

By default, re_data computes daily stats from the last day (it actually uses exact configuration from example for that)

### re_data:metrics_base

This is a set of metrics to compute for all monitored tables.
Some metrics like `row_count` are table level, others are specified
per column type: so that expression will be run for all columns of this type.

Here you only add metrics if you want to compute them for all tables which are monitored. You can also set up metrics to be computed for specific tables only (with table specific config)

:::info
schema changes are currently not set up using this parameter. Every monitored table is scanned for schema changed currently.
:::

### re_data:alerting_z_score

The threshold for alerting, you can leave it as is or update depending on your experience.  (By default, it's 3)

### re_data:anomaly_detection_look_back_days

The period which `re_data` considers when looking for anomalies. (By default, it's 30 days)
