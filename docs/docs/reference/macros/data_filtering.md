# Data Filtering

Data filtering refers to the process of choosing a smaller part of your dataset and using that subset for viewing or analysis.

Filtering may be used to:
- Look at results for a particular period of time.
- Exclude erroneous or "bad" observations from an analysis.
- Extract erroneous or "bad" observations from an analysis for manual [(by data stewards)](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/554646/best-practices-for-data-stewardship)/ [augmented (AI)](https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/enterprise-technology-and-performance/articles/augmented-data-management-beyond-the-hype.html) Data Quality Management.

re_data provides the following macros for filtering data. Check out the list of currently available filters and let us know if you could use some different ones on **[Slack ğŸ˜Š](https://www.getre.io/slack)** or **[Github](https://github.com/re-data/re-data/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=macro_request.md&title=%5BMACRO%5D)**.

### [filter_remove_duplicates](https://re-data.github.io/dbt-re-data/#!/macro/macro.re_data.filter_remove_duplicates)
*Arguments:*
- *relation: dbt model to perform the filtering on*
- *unique_cols: List of columns that uniquely identify each row*
- *sort_columns: Order in which we want to sort the partitioned rows. e.g. (created_at DESC, created_at ASC to choose the latest or earliest row based on the timestamp column*

Return type: table with filtered rows

This macro allows you to remove duplicate rows from a dbt model based on certain conditions.

```sql
  id |  status      |   updated_at    |
--------------------------------------+
 1   |  pending     |    13:00:45     |
 2   |  completed   |    13:05:23     |
 1   |  completed   |    13:10:35     |
 2   |  pending     |    13:04:49     |
 3   |  completed   |    13:30:00     |

 => select id, status, updated_at from {{ re_data.filter_remove_duplicates(ref('duplicated'), ['id'], ['updated_at desc']) }} duplicates

 -- After filtering, the resulting rows are:

  id |  status      |   updated_at    |
--------------------------------------+
 1   |  completed   |    13:10:35     |
 2   |  completed   |    13:05:23     |
 3   |  completed   |    13:30:00     |
```
### [filter_get_duplicates](https://re-data.github.io/dbt-re-data/#!/macro/macro.re_data.filter_get_duplicates)
*Arguments:*
- *relation: dbt base model to perform the filtering on*
- *unique_cols: List of columns that uniquely identify each row*
- *sort_columns: Order in which we want to sort the partitioned rows. e.g. (created_at DESC, created_at ASC to choose the latest or earliest row based on the timestamp column*

Return type: table with duplicate rows

along with the fields of the base model the macro returns duplication context in new fields:
re_data_duplicates_count - total number of duplicates with the same current key set
re_data_duplicate_row_number - number of current duplicate row inside the group of duplicates with the same current key set


This macro allows you to get duplicate rows from a dbt model based on certain conditions.

```sql
  id |  status      |   updated_at    |
--------------------------------------+
 1   |  pending     |    13:00:45     |
 2   |  completed   |    13:05:23     |
 1   |  completed   |    13:10:35     |
 2   |  pending     |    13:04:49     |
 3   |  completed   |    13:30:00     |

 => select id, status, updated_at,
	   re_data_duplicate_group_row_count, 
	   re_data_duplicate_group_row_number
	from {{ re_data.filter_get_duplicates( ref('duplicated') , ['id'], ['updated_at desc']) }}  duplicates

 -- After filtering, the resulting rows are:

 id | updated_at |  status   | re_data_duplicate_group_row_count | re_data_duplicate_group_row_number
----+------------+-----------+-----------------------------------+------------------------------------
  1 | 13:10:35   | completed |                                 2 |                                  1
  1 | 13:00:45   | pending   |                                 2 |                                  2
  2 | 13:05:23   | completed |                                 2 |                                  1
  2 | 13:04:49   | pending   |                                 2 |                                  2
```
