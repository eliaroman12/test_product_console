# Welcome to toy shop!

Welcome to a re_data getting started tutorial. We will prepare, analyze and monitor toy shop data here. The toy shop is a fictional e-commerce shop ðŸ™‚

It's an example of how a re_data project can work and help you improve data in your data warehouse


## Setting up toy shop project
Install re_data if you don't have it already
```bash
pip install re_data
```

Set up a dbt project containing the toy shop data using the re_data CLI.

```bash
re_data init toy_shop
cd toy_shop/
```

## Toy shop data
You would observe that the project has two seed files included:
  - toy_shop/seeds/customers.csv
  - toy_shop/seeds/orders.csv

And it also contains one model:
- toy_shop/models/pending_orders_per_customer.sql

:::info
Both seeds & model are already configured to be monitored by re_data, we will describe this configuration later on during the tutorial
:::

:::info
We use seeds instead of sources much more often than you would normally do in dbt. This is due to the convenient setup dbt offers for seeds
:::

## Profile setup

For re_data to work you will need dbt connection with the name `toy_shop` (project name we used) Here are examples of how it could look like in dbs supported by re_data, you can also check more details on connection configuration in  **[dbt profiles docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/profiles.yml)**.


<Tabs
  defaultValue="bigquery"
  values={[
    {label: 'BigQuery', value: 'bigquery'},
    {label: 'Snowflake', value: 'snowflake'},
    {label: 'Redshift', value: 'redshift'},
    {label: 'Postgres', value: 'postgres'}
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="snowflake">

```yml title=~/.dbt/profiles.yml
toy_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      account: xxx
      user: xxx
      password: xxx
      database: database
      warehouse: warehouse
      schema: toy_shop
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bigquery">

```yml title=~/.dbt/profiles.yml
toy_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      project: xxx
      schema: toy_shop
      location: US

```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="redshift">

```yml title=~/.dbt/profiles.yml
toy_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: redshift
      host: xxx
      user: xxx
      password: xxx
      port: 5439
      dbname: xxx
      schema: toy_shop
      threads: 4
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="postgres">

```yml title=~/.dbt/profiles.yml
toy_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: xxx
      user: xxx
      password: xxx
      port: 5432
      dbname: xxx
      schema: toy_shop
      threads: 4
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Loading data & creating models

Now you are ready to load toy_shop seed data & create project models.

```yaml
# load seed files into the database
dbt seed
# Compute models for toy_shop project, only pending_orders_per_customer table in this case.
dbt run --select package:toy_shop
```

After this step 3 tables should be available in the data warehouse of your choice:

```sql title="Loaded data"
toy_shop=> SELECT * FROM toy_shop.orders;
 id  | customer_id |     status      | amount |    time_created
-----+-------------+-----------------+--------+---------------------
