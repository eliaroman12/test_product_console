  - end-date (*default: today*) - end date of period for which you generate overview
  - interval (*default: days:1*) - basic time grain for the overview, supported values - *days*, *hours*, example: **days:7**, **hours:1**.
  - re-data-target-dir - directory to store artefacts generated by re_data. Defaults to the 'target-path' used in dbt_project.yml.
  - dbt-vars - This accepts a valid YAML dictionary as string which is passed down to the dbt command using [--vars](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-variables).
