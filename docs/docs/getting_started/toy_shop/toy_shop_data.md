# Welcome to a toy shop!

Welcome to a re_data getting started tutorial. We will prepare, analyze and monitor toy shop data here. The toy shop is a fictional e-commerce shop ðŸ™‚

It's an example of how a re_data project can work and help you improve data in your data warehouse

## Toy shop data
Toy shop DB has 4 tables which we would like to observe:
  - customers
  - orders
  - order_items
  - companies

```sql title=toy_shop_schema
                        Table "toy_shop.customers"
