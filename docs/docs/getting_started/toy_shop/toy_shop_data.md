# Welcome to toy shop!

Welcome to a re_data getting started tutorial. We will prepare, analyze and monitor toy shop data here. The toy shop is a fictional e-commerce shop ðŸ™‚

It's an example of how a re_data project can work and help you improve data in your data warehouse


## Setting up toy shop project
Install re_data if you don't have it already
```bash
pip install re_data
```

Set up a dbt project containing the toy shop data using the re_data CLI.

```bash
re_data init toy_shop
cd toy_shop/
```

## Toy shop data
You would observe that the project has two seed files included and we are going to use re_data to monitor these tables
  - toy_shop/seeds/customers.csv
  - toy_shop/seeds/orders.csv

The project also contains a model which can be monitored with re_data as well
- toy_shop/models/pending_orders_per_customer.sql

:::info
We use seeds instead of sources much more often than you would normally do in dbt. This is due to the convenient setup dbt offers for seeds
:::

## Profile setup

For re_data to work you will need dbt connection with name `toy_shop` to some test DB. Here is example of how it would look like for postgres, if need more details on that check out dbt **[docs.](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/profiles.yml)**

```yml title=~/.dbt/profiles.yml
toy_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: xxx
      user: xxx
      password: xxx
      port: 5432
      dbname: xxx
      schema: toy_shop
      threads: 4
```

## Loading data & creating models

Now you are ready to load toy_shop seed data & create project models. Notice we exclude re_data from being run now, as we will want to run it in a separate process.

```yaml
# load seed files into the database
dbt seed
# Set up the models of toy_shop only, pending_orders_per_customer in this case.
dbt run --exclude package:re_data
```

```sql title="Loaded data"
toy_shop=> SELECT * FROM toy_shop.orders;
 id  | customer_id |     status      | amount |    time_created
