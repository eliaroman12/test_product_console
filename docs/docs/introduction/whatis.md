# What is re_data?

re_data is an open-source data reliability framework for modern data stack. ðŸ˜Š

Currently, re_data focuses on observing the dbt project (together with underlying data warehouse - Postgres, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift).

# Live demo


Check out our **[live demo](https://re-data.github.io/re-data/ui-latest/#/alerts)** of what re_data can do for you! ðŸ˜Š

![GraphExample](/screenshots/ui/graph.png)

# Features

## Alerts
Get information about suspicious data patterns (anomalies) and schema changes automatically. re_data detects trends in your data and creates alerts if something seems suspicious.

## Metrics
Monitor predefined and custom metrics about your data. All metrics are stored in your database and accessible for you. re_data custom metrics can be standard dbt macros which make it very easy to add them to your project.

## Asserts
re_data contains asserts library which enable you to test computed metrics using standard dbt tests for models. This is additonal step you *can* do to make sure data is correct.

## Test history
re_data stores dbt tests history and let's you investigate details like code run or failures for each runned test.

## Lineage
re_data shows data lineage for your data warehouse. (This is imported from the dbt graph). You can navigate your data & investigate alerts & metrics related to each node in the graph.

## Macros
re_data ships with a set of macros to save you time and some pain of writing code for cleaning / normalizing / validating your data. Use them to make your project cleaner ðŸ˜Š. You can also use them as a base for your own metrics or data tests.

## Notifications
re_data sends notifications about suspicious data patterns, schema changes to your Slack so you can react quickly and fix the issues.

# Getting started

re_data is very easy to add to existing dbt projects. Check out **[quickstart](/docs/getting_started/installation/for_dbt_users)** instructions and follow **[toy shop](/docs/getting_started/toy_shop/toy_shop_data)** tutorial to see how you can generate re_data reliability data & UI for your data warehouse.

If you are not using dbt, re_data can still be a great option to start monitoring your existing tables. Check out installation for new users: **[new to dbt](/docs/getting_started/installation/new_to_dbt)** in this case.
