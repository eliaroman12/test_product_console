# Welcome to our docs!

At re_data we are helping data teams (and theirs users!) to keep data reliable. We believe open-source is quite often the right answer for data apps and that's why we wrote `re_data` dbt native library for data reliability, in line with that we also run `re_cloud` which helps collobarate on data issues found in a different open-source apps.

## re_data

re_data is an open-source data reliability framework build for modern data stack.

re_data focuses on observing the dbt project and lets you:
 - get alerts about bad data
 - compute data quality metrics
 - write your own data asserts
 - and more ðŸ˜Š

To start with re_data go to **[introduction](/docs/re_data/introduction/whatis_data)** ðŸš€

Check out our **[live demo](https://re-data.github.io/re-data/ui-latest/#/alerts)** of what re_data can do for you! ðŸ˜Š

## re_cloud
re_cloud allows you to very easily host and collaborate on data reports from different data apps. Some we are currently supporting are: 

- re_data ðŸ˜Š
- dbt docs
- great_expectations
- pandas_profiling
- jupyter notebooks
- custom reports

We think of `re_cloud` as a control center for you data. We wrote a simple `re_cloud` library (available as a python library) to upload supported reports to the cloud.

To start with a cloud you can create **[a free account here ðŸ˜Š](https://cloud.getre.io/#/register)**
or check our **[introduction docs](/docs/re_cloud/whatis_cloud)** for more information on it.
